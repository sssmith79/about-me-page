    		Introduction
    	</p>
    <p>I am learning to code so websites I build don't look like crap. In the past I have built sites almost solely with WordPress and the Genesis Framework from StudioPress. I would still like to implement certain aspects of WordPress into some websites but I want to learn to hand code also.
